=== Level 1

The first level of the Building Block View is a overall glance at the main blocks of the app:

As the app is based in the Model-View-Controller structure, the purpose of the blocks is pretty clear in general lines. Nonetheless, there are details that need further explanation:

* Model
** Abstraction of the data structures needed for the app.
** Serves for storage of the information fetched from the POD.
** Is modified by the Controller and modifies the visual components of the View.

* View
** Form of interaction with the app for the users.
** Provides ways of interacting with complex components in a user-friendly way.
** Is modified by the Model and interacts with the Controller to get things done.

* Controller
** "Brain" of the app, knows what to do and how in order to perform several user operations
** Is formed by services, libraries and methods to work with either POD, user or app data.
** Is told by the View to perform actions and their results are reflected in the Model.

=== Level 2

** contact.model.ts:
