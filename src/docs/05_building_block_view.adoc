== Building Block View

=== Scope & Context
Users can read and write messages using DeChat, which, through a user-friendly interface, manages the POD storage and the data linking of the user and its contacts.

=== Level 1

The first level of the Building Block View is a overall glance at the main blocks of the app:

As the app is based in the Model-View-Controller structure, the purpose of the blocks is pretty clear in general lines. Nonetheless, there are details that need further explanation:

* Model
** Abstraction of the data structures needed for the app.
** Serves for storage of the information fetched from the POD.
** Is modified by the Controller and modifies the visual components of the View.

* View
** Form of interaction with the app for the users.
** Provides ways of interacting with complex components in a user-friendly way.
** Is modified by the Model and interacts with the Controller to get things done.

* Controller
** "Brain" of the app, knows what to do and how in order to perform several user operations
** Is formed by services, libraries and methods to work with either POD, user or app data.
** Is told by the View to perform actions and their results are reflected in the Model.

=== Level 2
And at level 2, a view of the components and ths services

* Model: Storage of the contacts, chats, friends and messages of the user without being parsed into a html element.
** contact.model.ts
** chat.model.ts
** friend.model.ts
** message.model.ts
* View: Visual representation of the elements once parsed into html components
** Contact List View
** Chat View
** Friend List View
** Message View
** Login View
* Controller:
** contact.service: For parsing the contacts from the model into html.
** rdf.service: For writing and reading from the contents of the PODs.
** solid.auth.service: For session handling management.
