== Cross-cutting Concepts

//8.1
=== Domain Concepts


[cols="1,6"]
|===
| *Entity* | *Description*
| User | The person using the application
| Friend | Person tagged as 'knows' in the POD, can become also a contact.
| Contact | Friend that the user have chats with.
| Message | String, link, video or audio.
| Chat | Set of messages between two contacts.
| Group Chat | Chat but for three or more contacts.

//8.2
=== User Experience Concepts

==== User interface

DeChat has a web interface with a side-menu that allows users to view their chats with contacts (including groups) and a contact list. These two can be searched for specific results using their respective filter button. The side menu also has a button to change the chat settings and a button to create new group chats. The application has a chat view too, for reading and writing messages to other users.

It's a Single Page Application written in JavaScript using Angular JS.

==== Internationalization (i18n)
Initially we had planned to internationalize the user interface of the application, but we ended up short of time so we did not do it. Nevertheless, there are no components other than strings, so the development process should be fairly easy.


//8.3
=== Safety & Security Concepts

==== Safety
The parts of the system that have life endangering aspects inherit from the bases of P2P computing. In case someone tried to reach dangerous goals with DeChat, we can't respond for the misuse of the software.

==== Security
.Credentials
The security of the user credentials depends on the user's pc and web browser, and in the strength of the Solid session manager.

.User Data
In a P2P system, the only data leak that could be made depends on the human factor of sharing something unintentionally.

//8.4
=== Architecture & Design Patterns

.Model-View-Controller
The user interface is based in Angular, and the work methodology of Angular is based on this pattern.

//8.5
=== Under-the-hood

==== Persistency
All user data is stored in their POD through the solid-file-client library.

==== Transaction Handling
There is no sort of rollback for preventing unfinished transactions implemented yet. 

==== Session Handling
The management of the session is made with solid-file-client.

==== Reporting
Bugs, ideas, recommendations and anything else can be made through the https://github.com/Arquisoft/dechat_en3b/issues[issues page] of the GitHub project, following the https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue[standards for opening an issue].


//8.6
=== Development Concepts

==== Configurability
There is no way of configuring the application to your like yet (other than changing the source code by yourself and recompiling the application).

==== Testing
The following tests are implemented:

* Acceptance tests: Written in Gherkin, using Protractor-Cucumber.
* Browser-Based tests: Developed using Selenium.
* Load tests: Using Gatling.
* Monitoring & Profiling: With Google Chrome DevTools.

==== Profiling
During the profiling operation in Google Chrome using DevTools with an slowed processor it was noted that the most time consuming step in the application is the script evaluation. Therefore, it should be the first to look at when optimizing the application. 


//8.7
=== Operational Concepts

==== Disaster-Recovery

.User Data
The data of the application is stored in servers independent from the app, so the responsibility of making backups from the PODs from time to time resides in the server's managers. Users can make backups of their PODs into their PCs whenever they want. If your Solid POD server falls, there are more to work with, so even if you lose your information you can use the app from other server.

.Application
The recovery is dependant of GitHub. If anything happens to their servers the application would be down until they manage the disaster.

==== Scalability
Initially, the scalability issues we could have were solved.

==== High Availability
Once a new version of the app is made, the only time it takes is from merging the new contents from the development branch with the master branch. Once that process is completed, refreshing the web should show the new features.

As long as GitHub and a Solid server work, there is not such a thing as a "downtime" and you can use the app freely.

WARNING: Notice that your chats, contacts and such will be lost if the Solid server from the provider of your POD gets destroyed or something similar. Making a new POD in a different server allows you to use the app, but you will need to make new friends and contacts.

//Discarded:
// === Ergonomics (?)
// === Code Generation (included in Build, Test, Deploy)
// === Parallelization / Threading (We don't work with this)
// === Clustering (Is the opposite of what we want?)
// ==== Process Control (?)
//==== Communication & Integration
//==== Exception & Error Handling
//==== Business rules
//==== Batch
//==== Administration
//    -Makes no sense in P2P connections
//    -Privacy but also can proliferate illegal stuff

//==== Build, Test, Deploy
//    -Software needed
//    -Steps for each part
