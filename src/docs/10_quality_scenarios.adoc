=== Quality Scenarios

Sorted by type, the following tables explain the quality scenarios from the quality tree.

.Usability Scenarios
[cols="2,4,1"]
|===
| *Scenario* | *Concretization* | *Priority* footnote:disclaimer[Priority is divided in _Importance_ and _Implementation's difficulty_] 
| App feels familiar to the users | When users see the interface, the knowledge from using similar applications in the past helps them using DeChat | High, Medium
| Standard display of elements | Users have interface components where they would expect them to be | High, Medium
| Smart interface design | The usability tests of the app changed their fashion, adjusting it for a better working time  | High, High
| Accesibility standards | A mouse is not needed to use the app, and the color codes are not prohibitive for users with visual impairments | Medium, Medium
| Cool-looking colors and elements | Interface has a good looking style with a Solid-like color palette, which altogether invites you to use it  | Low, Low

.Privacy Scenarios
[cols="2,4,1"]
|===
| *Scenario* | *Concretization* | *Priority* footnote:disclaimer[]
| Data can't be intercepted by unrelated entities| While two users are chatting, nobody other than those two people is able to get that information | High, Medium
| The data of the app is decentralized | Data remains safe if the server hosting the app falls | High, High 
| Users choose where to store their data | From an official Solid server to your own personal computer, you choose where to save the application's data | High, High

.Performance Scenarios
[cols="2,4,1"]
|===
| *Scenario* | *Concretization* | *Priority* footnote:disclaimer[]
| Interactions with the UI are reflected within a reasonable time | The UI shows feedback from your actions fast (e.g. sending a message an seeing automatically in your chat) | Medium, Medium
| The new data is shown in the partner's chat within a reasonable time* | Once a message is sent, it should not take more than 1-2 seconds to be seen in the UI of your chat partner| Medium, Low
| The system has no downtime and is available in their web always | Updates are automatic, do not take user time, and the app is available as long as the server does not crash | Medium, Low
| The loading of information does not leave the system unavailable for more than 5 seconds| Loading big chunks of data (chats, messages, contacts...), specially when you log in, puts the system in a "waiting to use" scenario that has to be minimal | Medium, Medium

.Modifiability Scenarios
[cols="2,4,1"]
|===
| *Scenario* | *Concretization* | *Priority* footnote:disclaimer[]
| Work methodologies are clear| Developers can check the documentation to know how to work in the project  | Medium, Low
| Project's architecture and module's purposes are clear and coherent| Developers can check the documentation to know where to work in the project | Medium, Low
| Different tools and technologies are implemented for the different test cases | Having the test setup already prepared eases the testing process, having only to develop the cases | Medium, Medium
