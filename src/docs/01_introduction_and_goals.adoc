== Introduction and Goals


DeChat is a messaging application such as WhatsApp, Line, or Telegram, but with the main difference that it is based in a decentralized architecture to work. This means, among other interesting features, that the data storage and the app are independent, so you decide where all your information is saved.

Even though it has a different approach to an existing technology, it implements the same features as an user of a similar app would expect. Some of these features include:

* Chats between one or more people.
* Notifications (when being spoken, invited to a group chat...).
* File sharing (image, video, gif...).
* Message portability between other decentralized chat applications.

=== Requirements Overview

The requirements of the project are set by the teachers of the Software Architecture course and the people from Solid and Inrupt. They are the following:
* Implement continuous integration (with Travis).
* Keep a good quality code (between an A and a B, tracked with Codacy).
* Have a test coverage of 60%-90% (tracked with coveralls).
* Definition and use of code conventions.
* And all of these from the [https://labra.solid.community/public/SoftwareArchitecture/AssignmentDescription/](Course Guide and the Inrupt Challenge).

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Goal | Scenario

|Availability
|Be able to use the app as long as there is internet connection and your POD is in a working Solid server.

|Modifiability
|Personalization of the user interface to your like (Night mode, contact sorting...).

|Performance
|Low latency for working with the app (sending and receiving messages in a small time span, fast data load...).

|Portability
|Use the same app from either a web navigator, a native application installed in a computer or your mobile phone.

|Privacy
|Define which data which people can see and interact with.

|Reliability
|Users can rely in that their information is not used as a selling product. 

|Scalability
|Support of a huge number of concurrent users.

|Security
|No malware should compromise the private information of the users.

|Usability
|Following the standards from similar apps, the user will feel familiar and know how to use the app even without needing a manual.
