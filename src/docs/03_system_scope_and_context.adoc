== System Scope and Context

DeChat allows real-time peer-to-peer communication with a decentralized structure. This means that two people can exchange information between them without depending on a third person. Their data is never shared with anyone outside this direct communication channel.


=== Business Context

In DeChat, communication is made via PODs. A user sends a message to one contact, the message is written in the writer's PODs, and then the message's link is shared with whoever they have chosen. The data of the app is composed by the user's information, plus the links to other user's messages that their owner has given the first user access to. 

//External data can't be cached because it would break the decentralization principles, or does it?

=== Technical Context

Using RDF we establish links between users. The process is divided in two steps: 

* An identificator that ensures that the POD and the user's data match, and allows the user to enter in the second part, if everything is correct.
* A chat where users can establish the connection with other users and share information between them in our decentralized chat.
