== System Scope and Context

DeChat allows real-time peer-to-peer communication with a decentralized structure. This means that two people can exchange information between them without depending on a third person. Their data is never shared with anyone outside this direct communication channel.


=== Business Context

Communication is made via PODs: A user sends a message to one contact, the message is written in the writer's PODs, and then the message's link is shared with whoever the writer has chosen. The data of the app is composed by the user's information, plus the links to other user's messages that their owner has given the first user access to. 

//External data can't be cached because it would break the decentralization principles, or does it?

In this example, each user has private messages to each other user, but also group messages to the other two. 


=== Technical Context

The communication looks simple, but there are some things that have to be taken into account:

* DeChat cannot access directly to the raw information of a POD, there has to be an interface that fetches the relevant data and sends it to the app.
* Reading and writing in PODs has to be asynchronous for several reasons, WebRTC manages the petitions to the PODs for not compromising the performance of the app.
* A message buffer/cache is important for a fast access to the most requested data.

Currently, the interface and the reading and writing of PODs are based in RDFLib.
